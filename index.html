        <div class="answer">
          Once your order is successfully submitted, the warehouse then
          processes your order the following business day. It is then picked,
          packed, and dispatched. Once it is on its way to you, you will receive
          an email notification containing your tracking information, along with
          an estimated delivery date from our partner courier, UPS.
